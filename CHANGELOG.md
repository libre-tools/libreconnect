      - Established mock device discovery system ready for mDNS integration
      - Verified clean builds for both debug and release APK generation
      - All 9 plugin interfaces fully functional with intuitive user experiences

### Changed
- mDNS integration in `daemon` crate temporarily put on hold due to library issues.
- Rust-Android FFI integration put on hold due to build complexities; FFI is currently simulated in the Android app.
- Updated rustls imports for version 0.22 compatibility with `rustls_pki_types`
- Plugins now provide actual system functionality instead of just logging messages
- **Android UI navigation paradigm**: Removed bottom navigation bar in favor of cleaner single-screen navigation with floating action buttons

- **Icon system**: Migrated from Material Design icons to Lucide icons for modern, consistent iconography
- **About screen redesign**: Complete visual overhaul with hero section, feature grid, and responsive layout
- **Build system modernization**: Updated to Java 21, Kotlin 2.2.0, and latest Android SDK 36
- **Service integration**: Connected UI components to background service with proper state management

### Fixed
- Compilation errors with rustls 0.22 API changes
- Missing trait imports for enigo input simulation
- Thread safety issues with battery manager
- Plugin constructor compatibility with daemon initialization
- Android UI compilation issues with icon references and navigation structure
- Responsive layout issues on different screen sizes
- All Kotlin compilation errors related to missing dependencies and imports

- Navigation parameter mismatches between MainActivity and screen components
- Build configuration issues with Gradle dependency resolution

### Removed
- `android_ffi` crate.
- Bottom navigation bar from Android UI for cleaner user experience
- Search icon from app bar (replaced by floating action button)
- Unused UI components and deprecated icon references
- JmDNS dependency complexity in Android implementation (replaced with mock for now)
