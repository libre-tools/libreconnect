# LibreConnect Android-Rust Integration Testing Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for validating the LibreConnect Android-Rust integration. Follow these steps to ensure all components work correctly after replacing mock data with real device communication.

## üìã Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- **Desktop/Laptop**: Linux, Windows, or macOS with Rust installed
- **Android Device**: Android 13+ with USB debugging enabled
- **Network**: Both devices on same WiFi network

### Software Requirements
- **Rust**: Latest stable version (`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs/ | sh`)
- **Android Studio**: For APK installation and debugging
- **ADB**: Android Debug Bridge for device communication

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone and prepare LibreConnect
git clone <libreconnect-repo>
cd libreconnect

# Build Rust daemon
cargo build --release --bin libreconnectd

# Build Android APK
cd mobile/android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## üîß Phase 1: Basic Connectivity Testing

### Step 1: Network Preparation

1. **Verify Network Connectivity**
   ```bash
   # On desktop, find IP address
   ip addr show | grep inet
   # Note your WiFi IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
   
   # On Android, check WiFi connection
   # Settings ‚Üí WiFi ‚Üí [Your Network] ‚Üí Check IP
   # Should be same subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.xxx)
   ```

2. **Test Network Reachability**
   ```bash
   # From desktop, ping Android
   ping [ANDROID_IP]
   
   # From Android terminal app
   ping [DESKTOP_IP]
   ```

### Step 2: Start Rust Daemon

1. **Launch LibreConnect Daemon**
   ```bash
   cd libreconnect
   RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin libreconnectd
   ```

2. **Verify Startup Messages**
   Look for these log entries:
   ```
   üöÄ LibreConnect Daemon starting...
   üì± Local device: [Your Device Name]
   üîå Available plugins: 9
   üîç mDNS discovery started
   ‚úÖ LibreConnect Daemon started successfully
   üåê Listening on port 1716
   ```

3. **Test mDNS Service Registration**
   ```bash
   # On Linux/macOS, verify mDNS service
   avahi-browse -rt _libreconnect._tcp.local.
   # Should show your desktop device
   ```

### Step 3: Install and Launch Android App

1. **Install APK**
   ```bash
   cd libreconnect/mobile/android
   adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

2. **Enable Logging**
   ```bash
   # Open separate terminal for Android logs
   adb logcat -s LibreConnectService:D DeviceDiscovery:D NetworkManager:D
   ```

3. **Launch App**
   - Open LibreConnect on Android device
   - Grant all permissions when prompted
   - Navigate to "Discovery" screen

### Step 4: Device Discovery Test

1. **Start Discovery**
   - Tap "Scan for Devices" in Android app
   - Watch for discovery logs in Android logcat:
   ```
   D/DeviceDiscovery: Starting real mDNS device discovery
   D/DeviceDiscovery: JmDNS initialized on [IP]
   D/DeviceDiscovery: Service resolved: [Device Name]
   I/DeviceDiscovery: Discovered device: [Name] (DESKTOP) at [IP]:1716
   ```

2. **Verify Device Appears**
   - Desktop device should appear in discovered devices list
   - Check device name, type (Desktop/Laptop), and IP address
   - Status should show "Not Connected"

3. **Troubleshooting Discovery Issues**
   ```bash
   # If device not discovered, check:
   
   # 1. Firewall (disable temporarily)
   sudo ufw disable  # Ubuntu
   
   # 2. mDNS service on Android
   adb logcat -s jmdns:D
   
   # 3. Network connectivity
   ping [OTHER_DEVICE_IP]
   
   # 4. Port availability
   netstat -ln | grep 1716
   ```

## üîó Phase 2: Connection Testing

### Step 1: Establish Connection

1. **Connect to Device**
   - In Android app, tap discovered device
   - Tap "Connect" button
   - Watch connection logs:

   ```
   D/NetworkManager: Connecting to [Device] at [IP]:1716
   D/NetworkManager: Successfully connected to [Device]
   D/LibreConnectService: Device connected: [Device]
   ```

   **Rust daemon logs:**
   ```
   üì® Client connected from [ANDROID_IP]
   üì® Received message from [ANDROID_IP]: DeviceInfo
   ‚úÖ Device paired: [Android Device]
   ```

2. **Verify Connection Status**
   - Device status should change to "Connected"
   - Connection indicator should show green/connected state

### Step 2: Basic Message Exchange

1. **Ping Test**
   - In Android app, go to connected device details
   - Look for ping/connectivity test option
   - Expected logs:
   ```
   # Android
   D/NetworkManager: Sent message to [Device]
   D/NetworkManager: Received message from [Device]: Pong
   
   # Rust
   üì® Received message: Ping
   üì® Sent response: Pong
   ```
