# LibreConnect

**LibreConnect** is a secure, decentralized, open-source replacement for KDE Connect — built under the [LibreTools](https://github.com/libre-tools) ecosystem. It enables seamless sharing of input devices (keyboard, mouse), clipboard, files, notifications, and media controls between Linux desktops and mobile devices (Android/iOS) over a local network.

> No central servers. No metadata leaks. Just fast, secure, peer-to-peer control across your devices.

---

## 🔥 Vision

> To create a **modular, privacy-focused, local-first device linking platform** that replaces KDE Connect with a cleaner, faster, and more extensible architecture.

## 🔌 Plugin Architecture

All features are modular plugins communicating via a secure message bus.

| Plugin              | Status | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `ping`              | ✅ Done | Device reachability check                             |
| `clipboard-sync`    | ✅ Done | Real clipboard bi-directional sync with system integration |
| `file-transfer`     | ✅ Done | Complete file transfer with download management and I/O |
| `input-share`       | ✅ Done | Cross-platform keyboard/mouse simulation via system APIs |
| `notification-sync` | ✅ Done | System notification display with native integration |
| `battery-status`    | ✅ Done | Battery monitoring and status reporting |
| `media-control`     | ✅ Done | Media key simulation for playback control |
| `remote-commands`   | ✅ Done | Secure whitelisted command execution with safety controls |
| `touchpad-mode`     | ✅ Done | Phone-as-touchpad with mouse movement and click simulation |
| `slide-control`     | ✅ Done | Presentation control via keyboard shortcuts (F5, arrows, ESC) |

## 🔐 Security

- **TLS encryption** using self-signed, pinned certificates (`rustls`)
- **Manual pairing approval** to establish trust
- **No cloud**, **no phone-home**, **LAN-only default**
- Fully local-first and **peer-to-peer**

---

## 🌐 Network Model

```text
[PC A] (libreconnectd) <== TLS/QUIC ==> [Mobile] (Android App)
           |                                 |
       CLI / GUI                      Jetpack Compose UI / background service
```

- Discovery via mDNS
- Secure pairing + handshake
- Messaging via encrypted TCP/QUIC
- Plugins use message dispatcher to communicate
