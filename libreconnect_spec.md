# LibreConnect

**LibreConnect** is a secure, decentralized, open-source replacement for KDE Connect — built under the [LibreTools](https://github.com/libre-tools) ecosystem. It enables seamless sharing of input devices (keyboard, mouse), clipboard, files, notifications, and media controls between Linux desktops and mobile devices (Android/iOS) over a local network.

> No central servers. No metadata leaks. Just fast, secure, peer-to-peer control across your devices.

---

## 🔥 Vision

> To create a **modular, privacy-focused, local-first device linking platform** that replaces KDE Connect with a cleaner, faster, and more extensible architecture.

## 🔐 Security

- **TLS encryption** using self-signed, pinned certificates (`rustls`)
- **Manual pairing approval** to establish trust
- **No cloud**, **no phone-home**, **LAN-only default**
- Fully local-first and **peer-to-peer**

---

## 🌐 Network Model

```text
[PC A] (libreconnectd) <== TLS/QUIC ==> [Mobile] (Android App)
           |                                 |
       CLI / GUI                      Jetpack Compose UI / background service
```

- Discovery via mDNS
- Secure pairing + handshake
- Messaging via encrypted TCP/QUIC
- Plugins use message dispatcher to communicate
